# FiveM.Management
This management system is built to allow one of our customers to restart, start or stop his FiveM Server which is hosted on one of our Linux virtual machines. Our customer has no experience in Linux. Due to this management system, he is able to edit his server files through SFTP (FileZilla) and restart the server to update through a Discord integration. This is a secure way to perform updates without risking to break the virtual machine.
